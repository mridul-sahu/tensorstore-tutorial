# TensorStore & Orbax: From Basics to Advanced Checkpointing ðŸš€

This repository contains a hands-on Google Colab notebook designed to teach you **TensorStore** from the ground up, culminating in a practical understanding of how it powers **Orbax** for efficient machine learning checkpointing.

This tutorial was built interactively and contains a complete, battle-tested walkthrough that addresses common errors and nuances of the TensorStore API.

## ðŸ“– What You'll Learn

This notebook is a step-by-step guide that explains not just the "how," but also the "why." By the end, you will understand:

* **The Problem with Big Data:** Why tools like NumPy fall short and why TensorStore is necessary.
* **Core TensorStore Mechanics:** How to read and write large, out-of-memory arrays using `specs`, `drivers`, and `kvstores`.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** How TensorStore uses `Future` objects for high-performance I/O.
* **Cloud Integration:** How to use the same code to work with data on your local disk or in the cloud (e.g., GCS).
* **Advanced Features:** How to use virtual views for zero-cost transformations and transactions for data integrity.
* **Orbax Integration:** How Orbax uses TensorStore's specialized `ocdbt` driver to efficiently save and restore JAX model checkpoints.
* **Practical Skills:** How to manually inspect and convert Orbax checkpoints using the TensorStore library.
